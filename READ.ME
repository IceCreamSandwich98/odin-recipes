This is my first oden project. I already have a good foundational knowledge of html, css, and js. But in order to get my dream job, i need to refine my front end skills further.

This project will be a html webpage that displays recipies. I will likely divide the webpage into 3 sections. Breakfast, lunch, and dinners. Each will be displayed in their own page in the website
I will use a <ol> to displays the steps to create the recipes. and a <ol> to display ingredients.
Index.js will be the main hub. Three elements on top of webpage will link users to different pages (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
